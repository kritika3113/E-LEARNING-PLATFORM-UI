## EduTrack – Simple E-Learning UI

EduTrack is a very lightweight front-end project that shows a list of programming courses, lets users open a course page, and keeps their module progress in the browser. It uses only plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

### What's Included
- `index.html` – Landing page with hero section and highlighted courses.
- `courses.html` – Catalog view that lists every available course.
- `course.html` – Course details page with video embed, module checklist, and description.
- `progress.html` – Progress dashboard showing completion for each course and an average bar.
- `css/style.css` – Styles for layout, cards, buttons, and responsive behaviour.
- `js/app.js` – Holds the course data array, renders page sections, and stores progress in `localStorage`.


### Running the Project Locally
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any editor.
2. Double-click `index.html` to view it in your browser.
